You want to learn how to incorporate these features into your\\ncompany’s landscape architecture.\\nSAP HANA and High Availability\\nSAP HANA is specifically developed to take full advantage of the capabilities provided by\\nmodern hardware to increase application performance. By keeping all relevant data in the\\nmain memory, data processing operations are significantly accelerated.\\nAnother core design principle for SAP HANA is scalability. The SAP HANA database can be\\ndistributed across multiple hosts to achieve scalability in terms of size and user concurrency.\\nA distributed (also called “scale-out”) SAP HANA system spreads the data efficiently over the\\navailable servers, thereby achieving high scaling without I/O delays.\\nFor a company, the loss of critical business systems directly translates into loss of revenue. In\\nalmost every company, this is unacceptable. Therefore, the goal of every company should be\\nbusiness continuity, and consequently they should use systems designed for continuous\\noperation even in the presence of inevitable failures. These mission-critical systems require\\nhigh availability that is built-in on every level of the landscape, and should not rely on external\\ntools to provide these features.\\n© Copyright.

SAP HANA supports a broad range of recovery scenarios, from simple software errors\\nor hardware failures, to disasters that take out an entire site.\\nWhat is High Availability?\\nAvailability is usually indicated as a percentage of the operational uptime of a system,\\nmeasured over the course of a year. For example, if a system is designed to be available\\n99.99% of the time (sometimes called \"four nines\"), its downtime per year must be less than\\n0.01%, or 52 minutes and 56 seconds.\\nThat means less than an hour of downtime per year. This can be a very challenging target. To\\nmeet such challenging targets, high availability and disaster tolerance should be an integral\\npart of the architectural design, that is, implemented on every layer of the infrastructure.\\nDowntime is the consequence of outages, which may be planned downtime (such as that for\\nsystem upgrades or hardware replacements) or caused by unplanned downtime (such as that\\nfor software or hardware failures). Unplanned downtime can be triggered by equipment\\nmalfunction, software, or network failures, or a major disaster such as a fire, earthquake, a\\nregional power loss, or a construction accident which may decommission the entire data\\ncenter.\\nHigh Availability is a set of techniques, engineering practices, and design principles for\\nbusiness continuity. This is achieved by eliminating single points of failure (fault tolerance),\\nand providing the ability to rapidly resume operations after a system outage with minimal\\nbusiness loss (fault resilience).\\nFault Recovery is the process of recovering and resuming normal operations after an outage\\ndue to a fault.\\nLesson: Explaining the SAP HANA High Availability Features\\n© Copyright.

Preparing for disasters may require backing up data across longer\\ndistances, and may thus be more complex and costly.\\nRecovery - Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\\nCustomers commonly use two key measures to specify the recovery parameters of a system\\nfollowing an outage, the Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and the Recovery Time Objective\\n(RTO). The RPO and RTO of a system are illustrated in the following figure.\\nFigure 2: RPO and RTO\\nThe RPO is the maximum permissible amount of time during which operational data may\\nbe lost without the ability to recover. It is the time between the last backup (data or log)\\nand the crash. Almost every customer tries to achieve an RPO of 0, because the loss of\\nbusiness data is unacceptable.\\nThe RTO is the maximum permissible amount of time it takes to recover the system, so\\nthat normal operations can resume. Many companies aim for a near-zero RTO, because\\nduring the RTO period, normal business is interrupted. Interrupted business leads to loss\\nin revenue, which should be avoided as much as possible.\\nEliminating Single Points of Failure\\nThe key to achieving fault tolerance is to eliminate single points of failure by introducing\\nredundancy. SAP HANA hardware vendors deliver several levels of redundancy to avoid\\noutage due to component failure.\\nGenerally speaking, these techniques are transparent to SAP HANA’s operation.\\nNevertheless, they form a crucial line of defense against avoidable system outage, and\\ntherefore greatly contribute to business continuity.\\nHardware Redundancy\\nSAP HANA hardware vendors design multiple layers of redundancy in their hardware\\ncomponents and subsystems. These include redundant and hot-swappable Power\\nSupply Units (PSUs), fans, network interface cards, and enterprise-grade, error-\\ncorrecting code memory.\\nThese subsystems are designed in such a way that the redundant components can\\nsustain operations of the system even when other components fail.\\nUnit 1: SAP HANA High Availability Features Overview\\n© Copyright.

Enterprise-grade storage systems combine\\nmultiple physical drives into logical units, with built-in standard Redundant Array of\\nIndependent Disks (RAID) techniques for redundancy and error recovery. These include\\nmirroring (the writing of the same data to two different drives in parallel) and parity (the\\nwriting of extra bits to allow the detection and automatic correction of errors).\\nNetwork Redundancy\\nRedundant networks, network equipment, and network connectivity are required to avoid\\nnetwork failures affecting system availability. This is typically accomplished by deploying\\na completely redundant switch topology, using the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to\\navoid loops.\\nRouters can be configured with the Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) for automatic\\nfailover. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is commonly used to manage dual WAN\\nconnections.\\nData Center Redundancy\\nData centers that host SAP HANA solutions are equipped with Uninterrupted Power\\nSupply (UPS) units and backup power generators, redundant cooling systems, and multi-\\nsourced providers of network connectivity and electricity. This is done to achieve\\noperational availability in the presence of individual failures, and the significant reduction\\nof the probability of a business-impacting outage. Some enterprises operate fully\\nduplicated data centers, providing a high level of disaster tolerance.\\nSAP HANA High Availability Support\\nAs an in-memory database, SAP HANA must not only concern itself with maintaining the\\nreliability of its data in the event of failures. It should also be concerned with resuming\\noperations as quickly as possible with most of its data loaded back into memory.\\nThe following figure shows the phases of SAP HANA High Availability support.\\nFigure 3: SAP HANA RPO and RTO Support\\nPrepare Phase\\nThis first phase means being ready for disaster.

Due to this relaxed attitude, some check procedures might be skipped. This\\nis a disaster waiting to happen. Ensure that there are checks in place.\\nDetect Phase\\nBefore a takeover can be initiated, a fault must be detected. This fault detection can be\\ndone automatically or manually. In both cases, false positives must be avoided, so a\\nfailure must be re-tested.\\nTry to keep the detect phase as short as possible to avoid the loss of revenue while\\nsystems are down.\\nRecover Phase\\nWhen a real failure has been detected, the takeover is triggered. Depending on the fault,\\ndifferent recovery processes can be triggered. The different recovery processes have\\ndifferent recovery runtimes. The runtime is also heavily dependent on the available\\nhardware resources.\\nRamp-up Phase\\nAs soon as recovery is completed, the system is available in a ramp-up state. This is due\\nto the fact that not all the data is loaded into memory yet and external interfaces might\\nstill be initializing.\\nTo optimize this phase, you could investigate which data is needed most, so that this data\\ncan be loaded first.\\nFailback Phase\\nWhen all of the other phases are complete, the fault needs to be repaired. This can be a\\nhardware repair or software updates. Both take time and may require additional testing\\nbefore being applied to the production system.\\nWhen these repairs are done, the system may need to failback to the original data center\\nand hardware. This can be triggered immediately or at the next data center maintenance\\nwindow. If and when this failback is triggered is up to the customer, because this depends\\non contracts and service level agreements with third-party vendors and may involve\\nadditional costs.\\nSAP HANA Recovery Features\\nDifferent RPO and RTO values can be associated with different kinds of faults. Business-\\ncritical systems are expected to operate with an RPO of zero data loss in the case of local\\nfaults, and often even in the case of a disaster.\\nThe challenges of disaster recovery are different for locally recoverable faults compared to\\ntotal disasters. To achieve zero RPO and low RTO in a total disaster, data must be replicated\\nsynchronously over longer distances, which impacts regular system performance and may\\nrequire more expensive standby and failover solutions.\\nAll of this leads to trade-off decisions around the attributes of fault recovery functionality,\\ncost, and complexity. SAP offers complementary design options, including three levels of\\ndisaster recovery support and three levels of automatic fault recovery support. These are\\nsummarized in the following table.

Possible solutions to repair the error include restarting a failing service\\non the same server, or switching to a new host in the same data center. Such solutions can be\\nimplemented at almost no extra cost, as they are often a default part of the software and\\nhardware solution provided by hardware vendors.\\nService Auto-Restart\\nIn the event of a software failure of one of the configured SAP HANA services (Index\\nServer, Name Server, and so on), the failing service is restarted by the SAP HANA service\\nauto-restart watchdog function.\\nThis watchdog function is provided by the SAP HANA daemon process, which\\nautomatically detects the failure and restarts the stopped service process. Upon restart,\\nthe service loads data into memory and resumes its function. While all data remains safe,\\nthe service recovery takes some time.\\nSAP HANA Auto-Restart\\nThe SAP HANA database system can be configured in an auto-restart mode. This can be\\nuseful after a power failure. When the power returns and the Linux operating system has\\nbeen started successfully, the SAP HANA database system automatically performs a\\nstartup and recovery. The SAP HANA database system is available again for normal\\noperations as soon as the startup and recovery is finished.\\nHost Auto-Failover\\nThis is a local fault recovery solution that can be used in addition to, or as an alternative\\nmeasure to, system replication. One or more hosts are added to an SAP HANA database\\nsystem. These additional hosts are configured to work in standby mode.\\nAs long as they are in standby mode, the databases on these hosts do not contain any\\ndata and do not accept requests or queries. This means these additional standby hosts\\ncannot be used for other purposes, such as quality or test systems.\\nDisaster Recovery Support\\nBackups\\nSAP HANA is an in-memory database, but all the data is persisted on disk as well. Data is\\npersisted on disk by means of regular savepoints. These savepoints are performed by\\ndefault every five minutes. In between these savepoints, all the changes are recorded in\\ntransaction redo logs.\\nLesson: Explaining the SAP HANA High Availability Features\\n© Copyright. All rights reserved. 7'),\n",

These data and log backups must be shipped to the\\nsecondary site to make sure that the system can recover from a total disaster.\\nStorage Replication\\nThis is a method to continuously replicate all persisted data and log information to the\\nsecondary site. Several SAP HANA hardware partners offer a storage-level replication\\nsolution, which delivers a backup of the volumes or file-system to a remote, networked\\nstorage system.\\nSystem Replication\\nThis is a native SAP HANA high availability solution that provides a continuously-\\nreplicated SAP HANA system on the secondary site. The data is already loaded into\\nmemory, so takeover times are short in comparison to backup and storage replication\\nsolutions.\\nSystem Replication Active/Active\\nThis is a second native SAP HANA system replication solution that allows the data to be\\nread from the secondary system. In this setup, the secondary system can be used to\\nhandle the reporting workload without disrupting the primary system.\\nSystem Replication without Data Preload\\nThis is a third native SAP HANA scenario. In this solution, the secondary system does not\\npre-load data, and hence consumes very little memory. This allows the hosts of the\\nsecondary system to serve dual purposes. For example, for development, unit testing, or\\nQA with separate storage.

You need to understand which disaster\\nrecovery features are supported by the SAP HANA database.\\nBackups\\nBackups are one of the key disaster recovery features offered by SAP HANA.\\nSAP HANA uses in-memory technology, but of course, it fully persists any transaction that\\nchanges the data, such as row insertions, deletions, and updates, so it can resume from a\\npower outage without loss of data. SAP HANA persists two types of data to the storage\\nsystem, transaction redo logs and data changes in the form of savepoints.\\nFigure 5: SAP HANA Backups\\nA transaction redo log is used to record a change.

One goal of performing savepoints is to speed up restart. When starting a\\nsystem, logs need not be processed from the beginning, but only from the last savepoint\\nposition. Savepoints are coordinated across all processes (called SAP HANA services) and\\ninstances of the database to ensure transaction consistency. By default, savepoints are\\nperformed every five minutes, but this value is configurable.\\nSavepoints normally overwrite older savepoints, but it is possible to freeze a savepoint for\\nfuture use. This is called a snapshot. Snapshots can be replicated in the form of full data\\nbackups, which can be used to restore a database to a specific point in time. This can be\\nuseful in the event of data corruption, for instance. In addition to data backups, smaller\\nperiodic log backups ensure the ability to recover from fatal storage faults with minimal loss\\nof data.\\nSavepoints can be saved to local storage, and the additional backups can be saved to backup\\nstorage. Local recovery from the crash uses the latest savepoint, and then replays the last\\nlogs, to recover the database without any data loss. If the local storage was corrupted by the\\ncrash, it is still possible to recover the database from the data and log backups, possibly with\\nsome loss of data. Regularly shipping backups to a remote location over a network or using\\ncouriers can be a simple and relatively inexpensive way to prepare for a disaster. Depending\\non the frequency and shipping method, this approach may have a recovery time ranging from\\nhours to days.\\nStorage Replication\\nSAP HANA offers disaster recovery support for storage replication solutions provided by\\nhardware partners.\\nOne drawback of backups is the potential loss of data between the time of the last backup and\\nthe time of the failure. A preferred solution is to provide continuous replication of all persisted\\ndata. Several SAP HANA hardware partners offer a storage-level replication solution that\\ndelivers a backup of the volumes or file system to a remote, networked storage system. In\\nsome of these vendor-specific solutions, which are certified by SAP, the SAP HANA\\ntransaction only completes when the locally persisted transaction log has been replicated\\nremotely. This is called synchronous storage replication. Synchronous storage replication can\\nbe used only where the distance between the primary and backup site is relatively short\\n(typically 100 kilometers or less), allowing for sub-millisecond round-trip latencies.\\nDue to its continuous nature, storage replication (sometimes also called remote storage\\nmirroring) can be a more attractive option than backups, as it reduces the amount of time\\nbetween the last backup and a failure. Another advantage of storage replication is that it also\\nenables a much shorter recovery time. This solution requires a reliable, high-bandwidth and\\nlow-latency connection between the primary site and the secondary site.\\nUnit 1: SAP HANA High Availability Features Overview\\n© Copyright.

The administrator then restarts the SAP HANA\\nsystem. The administrator must ensure that the failed primary system can no longer write to\\nthe replicated storage by fencing it from the primary system. If the primary system is not\\nfenced, then there is a risk of data corruption. This corruption can occur because two systems\\ncan write to the same storage at the same time.\\nSystem Replication\\nSystem replication is available in every SAP HANA installation offering inherent disaster\\nrecovery support.\\nSystem replication is an alternative high availability solution for SAP HANA that provides an\\nextremely short RTO, and is compatible with all SAP HANA hardware partner solutions.\\nSystem replication employs an \"N+N\" approach, with a secondary standby SAP HANA\\nsystem with the same number of active nodes as the active, primary system. Each service and\\ninstance of the primary SAP HANA system communicates pairwise with a counterpart in the\\nsecondary system.\\nThe secondary system can be located near the primary system to serve as a rapid failover\\nsolution for planned downtime, or to handle storage corruption or other local faults.\\nAlternatively, it can be installed in a remote site to be used in a disaster recovery scenario.\\nIn addition, both approaches can be chained together with multi-tier system replication. Like\\nstorage replication, this disaster recovery option requires a reliable connection channel\\nbetween the primary and secondary sites. The instances in the secondary system operate in\\nrecovery mode. In this mode, all secondary system services constantly communicate with\\ntheir primary counterparts, replicate and persist data and logs, and load data to memory. The\\nmain difference to primary systems is that the secondary systems do not accept requests or\\nqueries.\\nLesson: Exploring Disaster Recovery in SAP HANA\\n© Copyright.

Worker machines process data; standby\\nmachines do not handle any processing and instead just wait to take over processes in the\\ncase of worker machine failure.\\nAuto-Failover for High Availability\\nAs an in-memory database, SAP HANA is not only concerned with maintaining the reliability of\\nits data in the event of failures, but also with resuming operations with most of that data\\nloaded back in memory as quickly as possible. Host auto-failover is a local fault recovery\\nsolution that can be used as a supplemental or alternative measure to system replication. One\\n(or more) standby hosts are added to an SAP HANA system, and configured to work in\\nstandby mode.\\nBefore installing a multiple-host system, it is important to consider whether high availability is\\nnecessary, and how hosts should be grouped to ensure preferred host auto-failover. For host\\nauto-failover to be successful, if the active (worker) host fails, the standby host takes over its\\nrole by starting its database instance using the persisted data and log files of the failed host.\\nThe name server of one of the SAP HANA instances acts as the cluster manager that pings all\\nhosts regularly. If a failing host is detected, the cluster manager ensures that the standby host\\ntakes over the role and the failing host is no longer allowed write access to the files (called\\n“fencing”) to avoid data corruption. The crash of a single service does not trigger failover,\\nbecause services are normally restarted by hdbdaemon.\\nHigh Availability Host Grouping\\nFigure 15: Host Grouping\\nLesson: Installing High Availability SAP HANA\\n© Copyright.

If there are multiple standby hosts in a\\nsystem, host grouping should be considered, because host grouping decides the allocation of\\nstandby resources if a worker machine fails. If no host group is specified, all hosts belong to\\none host group called \"default\". The more standby hosts in one host group, the greater the\\nfailover security.\\nIf each of the standby hosts is in a different host group, the standby host in the same group as\\nthe failing worker host is preferred. If a standby host is not available in the same host group,\\nthe system tries to fail over to a standby host that is part of another host group. The\\nadvantage of this configuration is that in an SAP HANA system with mixed machine\\nresources, similar sized machines can be grouped together.

The main\\nreason for distributing a system across multiple hosts (that is, scaling out) is to overcome\\nthe hardware limitations of a single physical server. This allows an SAP HANA system to\\ndistribute the load between multiple servers. In a distributed system, each index server is\\nusually assigned to its own host to achieve maximum performance.

If you need to use more memory or more CPU power beyond the limitation\\nof a single physical hardware box, you can use a distributed landscape consisting of multiple\\nhosts.\\nBefore you decide how to scale your SAP HANA implementation, there are several aspects\\nthat need to be considered, such as scaling data, performance, applications, and hardware.\\nScaling the Data\\nOne technique you can use to deal with planned data growth is to purchase more physical\\nRAM than is initially required, to set the allocation limit according to your needs, and then to\\nincrease it over time to adapt to your data. Once you have reached the physical limits of a\\nsingle server, you can scale out over multiple machines to create a distributed SAP HANA\\nsystem. You can do this by distributing different schemata and tables to different servers\\n(complete data and user separation). However, this is not always possible, for example, when\\na single fact table is larger than the server's RAM size.\\nThe most important strategy for scaling your data is data partitioning. Partitioning supports\\nthe creation of very large tables (billions of rows) by breaking them into smaller chunks that\\ncan be placed on different machines. Partitioning is transparent for most SQL queries and\\nother data manipulations.\\nScaling Performance\\nSAP HANA’s performance is derived from its efficient, parallel approach. The more\\ncomputation cores your SAP HANA server has, the better the overall system performance.\\nScaling performance requires a more detailed understanding of your workload and\\nperformance expectations. Using simulations and estimations of your typical query\\nworkloads, you can determine the expected load that a typical SAP HANA installation may\\ncomfortably manage. At the workload level, a rough prediction of scalability can be\\nestablished by measuring the average CPU utilization while the workload is running. For\\nexample, an average CPU utilization of 45% may indicate that the system can be loaded 2X\\nbefore showing a significant reduction in individual query response time.\\nLesson: Explaining SAP HANA Scale-Out\\n© Copyright.

Particular care must be taken in distributing the data so that the majority of\\nqueries match partitioning pruning rules. This accomplishes two goals: directing different\\nusers to different hosts (load balancing) and avoiding the network overhead related to\\nfrequent data joins across hosts.\\nScaling Hardware\\nSAP HANA is offered in a number of ways – in the form of an on-premise appliance, delivered\\nin a number of different configurations and \"sizes\" by certified hardware partners or by using\\nthe tailored data center integration model, and as part of a cloud-based service. This creates\\ndifferent system design options with respect to scale-up and scale-out variations. To\\nmaximize performance and throughput, SAP recommends that you scale up as far as\\npossible (acquire the configuration with the highest processor and memory specification for\\nthe application workload), before scaling out (for deployments with even greater data volume\\nrequirements).\\nNote:\\nSAP HANA hardware partners have different building blocks for their scale-out\\nimplementations. Therefore, you should always consult with your hardware\\npartner when planning your scale-out strategy.\\nIntroducing High-Availability in an SAP HANA system\\nIn the figure Scale-up vs Scale-out, the SAP HANA systems are only increased in size from\\n1TB to 12TB. In both scenarios, scale-up and scale-out, no high availability is introduced. High\\navailability can only be introduced in a scale-out setup with inclusion of standby nodes. A\\nscale-out configuration with high availability is shown in the figure High Availability and Scale-\\nout. One or more SAP HANA nodes can be configured as standby nodes.

The name server knows which tables,\\ntable replicas, or partitions of tables are located on which index server.\\nWhen processing a query, the index servers ask the name server about the locations of the\\ninvolved data. To prevent a negative impact on performance, the topology and distribution\\ninformation is replicated and cached on each host. In each SAP HANA system, there is one\\nmaster name server that owns the topology and distribution data. This data is replicated to all\\nother name servers, called slave name servers. The slave name servers write the replicated\\ndata to a cache in shared memory from where the index servers of the same instance can\\nread it.\\nThe master name server has its own persistence where it stores name server data (topology\\nand distribution data). The slave name servers have no persistence because they are only\\nholding replicated data.\\nLESSON SUMMARY\\nYou should now be able to:\\nIntroducing SAP HANA scale-out systems\\nUnit 2: SAP HANA Fault Tolerance\\n© Copyright.

SAP HANA supports the following different ways of distributing data across the\\nhosts:\\nA partitioned table splits its data in several blocks (partitions), and these partitions can be\\nstored on different index servers.\\nDifferent tables can be assigned to different index servers.\\nA table can be replicated to multiple index servers, for better query and join performance.\\nWhen you create new tables, or partitions, they are distributed to the available hosts by the\\nsystem. By default, a “round-robin” distribution method is used, but tables can also be\\npositioned by using the table placement rules or by specifying a host and port number with\\nthe SQL CREATE TABLE statement in the location clause. This gives the developer complete\\ncontrol over the positioning of individual tables.\\nSpecific applications may have predefined table distribution rules, and in some cases,\\nconfiguration files and documentation are available in SAP Notes to help you to set up the\\nnecessary partitioning and table placement rules.\\nIntroduction to Table Partitioning\\nThe partitioning feature of the SAP HANA database splits column-store tables horizontally\\ninto disjunctive sub-tables or partitions. In this way, large tables can be broken down into\\nsmaller, more manageable parts.\\nPartitioning is only available for tables located in the column store. The row store does not\\nsupport partitioning.\\nHint:\\nPartitioning is typically used in multiple-host systems, but it may also be\\nbeneficial in single-host systems.\\nTable partitioning is transparent for the application in a way that applications work properly\\nwith all partitioning strategies.

If the table\\nhas a primary key, these partitioning columns must be part of the key. The advantage of this\\nrestriction is that a uniqueness check of the key can be performed on the local server. You can\\nuse as many partitioning columns as required to achieve a good variety of values for an equal\\ndistribution.\\nFor more information about the SQL syntax for partitioning, see SAP HANA SQL and System\\nViews Reference.\\nRound-Robin Partitioning\\nRound-robin partitioning is used to achieve an equal distribution of rows to partitions.\\nHowever, unlike hash partitioning, you do not have to specify partitioning columns. With\\nround-robin partitioning, new rows are assigned to partitions on a rotation basis.

Therefore, all partitions\\nare considered in searches and other database operations.\\nDepending on the scenario, it is possible that the data in semantically-related tables\\nresides on the same server. Some internal operations may then operate locally instead of\\nretrieving data from a different server.\\nRange Partitioning\\nRange partitioning creates dedicated partitions for certain values or value ranges in a table.\\nFor example, a range partitioning scheme can be chosen to create a partition for each\\ncalendar month. Partitioning requires an in-depth knowledge of the values that are used or\\nare valid for the chosen partitioning column.\\nPartitions may be created or dropped as needed and applications may choose to use range\\npartitioning to manage data at a fine level of detail, for example, an application may create a\\npartition for an upcoming month so that new data is inserted into that new partition.\\nNote:\\nRange partitioning is not well suited for load distribution. Multi-level partitioning\\nspecifications address this issue.\\nWhen rows are inserted or modified, the target partition is determined by the defined ranges.\\nIf a value does not fit into one of these ranges, an error is raised. To prevent this, you can also\\ndefine an 'others' partition for any values that do not match any of the defined ranges.

To better understand this feature, you need to have hands-on experience\\nwith a slave node failing in a multi-host SAP HANA system.\\nFailure of an SAP HANA Node\\nHost auto-failover is a local fault recovery solution that can be used in addition to, or as an\\nalternative measure to, system replication. One (or more) standby hosts are added to an SAP\\nHANA system and configured to work in standby mode. If they are in standby mode, the\\ndatabases on these hosts do not contain any data and do not accept requests or queries. This\\nmeans that they cannot be used for other purposes, such as quality or test systems.\\nWhen a primary (worker) host fails, a standby host automatically takes its place. If neither the\\nname server process hdbnameserver, nor hdbdaemon respond to network requests (because\\nthe instance is stopped or the OS has been shut down or powered off), a host is marked as\\ninactive and an auto-failover is triggered. Since the standby host may take over operation\\nfrom any of the primary hosts, it needs shared access to all the database volumes. This can\\nbe accomplished by a shared, networked storage server, by using a distributed file system, or\\nwith vendor-specific solutions that use an SAP HANA programmatic interface, the Storage\\nConnector API, to dynamically detach and attach (mount) networked storage upon failover.\\n© Copyright.

No external cluster\\nmanager is required.\\nData consistency is a key requirement. Data might be corrupted if a failed host (like the\\noriginal host 2 in the previous figure) is allowed to restart and write data to disk in parallel\\nto the failover host (the new slave host 3 in the previous figure).\\nTo ensure data consistency at all times, it must be guaranteed that a failover does not happen\\n(or at least does not succeed and may not cause corrupt data) if the failed host can potentially\\nstill write data. To achieve this, the SAP HANA host auto-failover uses a combination of\\nheartbeat and fencing.\\nHeartbeat\\nThe following types of heartbeat are used to check if another host is active as the master\\nbefore starting the current host as the master or performing a failover:\\nTCP communication-based heartbeats:\\n- Ping from nameserver to nameserver with SAP HANA internal communication protocol\\n- Ping from nameserver to hdbdaemon with SAP HANA internal communication protocol\\nStorage-based heartbeats:\\nThe current master nameserver periodically updates heartbeat files located on different\\nstorage partitions:\\n- Shared storage for the SAP HANA binaries\\n- Storage partition 1 for the master node’s data\\nThese types of storage are typically connected with networks other than the inter-node\\nnetwork used for service-to-service communication (such as fiber channel for SAN or\\ndedicated Ethernet for NFS) and therefore these heartbeats provide additional value.\\nLesson: Understanding Failure of an SAP HANA Slave Node\\n© Copyright.

If the target master host detects\\nthat another master is still active, it terminates itself to let the other master continue. Without\\nthis, different hosts could try to become master and would fence each other repeatedly.\\nIn a split brain situation, a quorum is sometimes used to decide, which side should ‘survive’.\\nThis makes sense in stateless compute clusters to have the bigger parts of resources\\nremaining active. However, in SAP HANA, tables are bound to specific storage partitions and\\nservice instances. Tables in the other partition would not be accessible and applications\\ntypically cannot continue with some tables inaccessible. Therefore, SAP HANA lets the initial\\nmaster continue.\\nhdbnsutil\\nSome actions, supported by the hdbnsutil executable, access the persistence while the\\nsystem is stopped. To avoid data corruption caused by unexpected active or reviving services,\\nthis program also checks for active name servers with network and storage based heartbeats\\nand uses fencing to set the SCSI-3 persistent reservation.\\nSAN storages: After stopping hdbnsutil (or the name server), the SCSI-3 persistent\\nreservations are intentionally not released. This ensures that no other service unintentionally\\naccesses a persistence, such as still-running services on other hosts after a split-brain\\nsituation\\nUnit 2: SAP HANA Fault Tolerance\\n© Copyright.

The timeouts could be reduced, but this is not\\nrecommended, as it would not allow recovery from short network outages, or could\\nlead to a false failover decision in the case of heavy system load, where pings can take\\nlonger.\\n2. Failover execution\\nThe failover time is comparable to the time required for SAP HANA startup, because the\\nservices on a standby host are initially started, but run idle. During failover, they do the\\nsame initialization and persistence load as in regular service startups.\\nHost Start Order/Landscape Restart\\nAll hosts can be started concurrently. The master name server candidates have different\\npriorities as indicated by the role name MASTER 1, 2, and 3. The first master candidate\\nbecomes the active master. The index server roles, host roles, and storage partitions are\\nreset, meaning that all configured worker hosts are used as worker again, even if the\\nlandscape was in a failed over state before shutdown.\\nLesson: Understanding Failure of the SAP HANA Master Node\\n© Copyright.

So over time, the storage partitions\\nmay have different sorting compared to their initial state after installation.\\nAs of SPS12, a landscape restart considers the configured storage partitions, bringing the\\nsystem back to its original state. As a prerequisite, the master name server must be on its\\noriginal host (with a configured storage partition of 1). In an SAP HANA system replication\\nsetup, only the primary system performs this failback operation.\\nFailback\\nWhen a failover was performed and the failed host is available again, no automatic failback\\nhappens; the host starts as a standby. A controlled failback can be performed by stopping or\\nrestarting the configured standby host which, after a previous failover, is actually a worker.\\nAutomatic failback only happens when the complete landscape is restarted.\\nMaster Nameserver Candidates\\nThe initial host is a master candidate and the first two hosts added to a landscape become\\nmaster candidates. When a standby host is added and none of the master candidates is a\\nstandby host, the last master candidate is moved to the new standby host. Having a standby\\nhost in the master candidate list allows faster master host failover because it avoids the\\npreviously-mentioned double failover.\\nFailover Groups\\nDuring installation and with SAP HANA Studio, a failover group can be configured per host. If a\\nfailover target host is available in the same group, it is preferred over hosts from other groups.\\nThis can be used to achieve better 'locality' in large systems, to use network/storage\\nconnections with less latency. When the parameter nameserver.ini/[failover]/\\ncross_failover_group  is set to false, failover is restricted to hosts in the same group. This\\ncan be used to separate differently sized hardware or separate storage entities.\\nApplication Configuration\\nIn the connection information for SAP HANA SQL client libraries (for example, hdbuserstore),\\nyou can configure multiple host names. All master name server candidates should be\\nconfigured there. The master candidates can be found using the following SQL statement:\\nselect HOST from SYS.M_LANDSCAPE_HOST_CONFIGURATION where \\nNAMESERVER_CONFIG_ROLE like 'MASTER%' order by NAMESERVER_CONFIG_ROLE\\nApplication Error Handling\\nFailover is not seamless.

The disaster tolerance solution is based on replication mechanisms of\\nthe hard disk I/O subsystem. All the data that is written to the persistence (data volume and\\nlog volume) by the primary SAP HANA system is replicated to a second location (secondary).\\nThe SAP HANA instance of the second location is not active (cold standby).\\nThe mirroring is offered at the storage system level. It is offered together with the appliance\\nas a special offering by our partners. The hardware partner defines how this concept is finally\\nrealized with their operation possibilities.\\nGenerally, write requests are replicated to the hard disk I/O subsystem synchronously. When\\nthere are long distances between locations, the latency times for writing the redo log may\\nincrease. This means that the synchronous replication can be used up to certain distances\\nonly. The maximum distance depends on the performance requirements of the SAP HANA\\nsystem, the respective solution of the hardware partner, and the network configuration in the\\ncustomer environment.\\nSome hardware partners support an asynchronous transfer of the write requests, while the\\nconsistency of the data and transactions within the SAP HANA database is ensured. During a\\ntakeover in this case, the changes that were made last may be lost. In some application\\nscenarios, this loss can be accepted, but in other cases, it cannot.\\nFor example, in an SAP HANA data mart solution, data is replicated from a source system to\\nthe SAP HANA database using SLT. If the SAP HANA database loses the data that was\\ninserted last due to a failover, SLT does not transfer the missing data again. As a result, the\\ndata has to be reloaded to the tables of the SAP HANA database. In this environment, only a\\nsynchronous replication between the primary SAP HANA system and the secondary SAP\\nHANA system is useful.\\nSolutions with asynchronous replication can be used for longer distances between the\\nlocations because the latency times are not significantly affected when writing the redo log.\\nYou can expect an impact on performance for data changing operations as soon as the\\nsynchronous mirroring is activated. The impact depends heavily on various external factors\\nlike distance, connection between data centers, and so on. The synchronous writing of the log\\nwith the concluding COMMITs is crucial.\\nIn an emergency situation, the primary data center is no longer available and you must initiate\\na process for the takeover. So far, many customers have requested a manual process here,\\nbut an automated process can also be implemented. This take-over process then ends the\\nmirroring officially, mounts the disks to the already installed SAP HANA software and\\n© Copyright. All rights reserved. 104'),\n",

During a takeover, other\\nrunning systems are switched off, the replication between the locations is interrupted, the\\nmount points of the replicate are made available for the secondary servers, and the SAP\\nHANA system is started. When using servers of the secondary system for other SAP HANA\\nsystems, these do not use the hard disk storage system that contains the replicate of the\\nprimary system.\\nYou can run a development or QA instance of the three-tier installation on this secondary\\ncluster hardware, simply to use it until the takeover is executed. The take-over then stops\\nthese development or QA instances and mounts the production disks to the hosts. It requires\\nan additional set of disks for the development and QA instance.\\nThe same applies to asynchronous mirroring solutions for distant data centers (> 100 km).\\nSome hardware partners have concepts available to offer this asynchronous storage\\nreplication.

In this mode, all secondary system services constantly communicate with their\\nprimary counterparts.\\nA cluster across data centers with database controlled transfer is realized by system\\nreplication.\\nSystem replication has the following advantages:\\nMemory is continuously loaded on a secondary site in preparation for the possible\\ntakeover and occupies resources.\\nSwitch-over is faster than with storage replication or mirroring (2-5 minutes).\\nThere is a very short performance ramp (only minutes, not hours, without preparation).\\nSystem replication has the following disadvantages:\\nThe hardware (memory and CPU) is actively used on the secondary site for the standby or\\nshadow processes.\\nReplication Modes\\nFigure 67: Replication Modes\\nWhen the secondary system is started in recovery mode, each service component establishes\\na connection with its counterpart, and requests a snapshot of the data in the primary system.\\nFrom then on, all logged changes in the primary system are replicated. Whenever logs are\\npersisted in the primary system, they are also sent to the secondary system. A transaction in\\nthe primary system is not committed until the logs are replicated. What this means can be\\nconfigured by choosing one of the log replication modes:\\nAsynchronous: The primary system sends redo log buffers to the secondary system\\nasynchronously. The primary system commits a transaction when it has been written to\\nthe log file of the primary system and sent to the secondary system through the network. It\\ndoes not wait for confirmation from the secondary system.\\nThis option provides better performance because it is not necessary to wait for log I/O on\\nthe secondary system.

However, it is more vulnerable to data loss. Data changes may be lost on\\ntakeover.\\nSynchronous in-memory (default): The primary system commits the transaction after it\\nreceives a reply that the log was received by the secondary system, but before it has been\\npersisted. The transaction delay in the primary system is shorter, because it only includes\\nthe data transmission time.\\nSynchronous: The primary system does not commit a transaction until it receives\\nconfirmation that the log has been persisted in the secondary system. This mode\\nguarantees immediate consistency between both systems. However, the transaction is\\ndelayed by the time it takes to transmit the data to and persist it in the secondary system.\\nSynchronous with full sync: The log write is successful when the log buffer has been\\nwritten to the log file of the primary and the secondary instance. In addition, when the\\nsecondary system is disconnected (for example, because of network failure), the primary\\nsystems suspend transaction processing until the connection to the secondary system is\\nre-established. No data loss occurs in this scenario.\\nIf the connection to the secondary system is lost, or the secondary system crashes, the\\nprimary system resumes replication after a brief, configurable, timeout. The secondary\\nsystem persists, but does not immediately replay the received log. To avoid a growing list of\\nlogs, incremental data snapshots are transmitted asynchronously from time to time from the\\nprimary system to the secondary system. If the secondary system has to take over, only the\\npart of the log needs to be replayed that represents changes that were made after the most\\nrecent data snapshot. In addition to snapshots, the primary system also transfers status\\ninformation regarding which table columns are currently loaded into memory. The secondary\\nsystem correspondingly preloads these columns. In the event of a failure that justifies full\\nsystem takeover, an administrator instructs the secondary system to switch from recovery\\nmode to full operation. The secondary system, which already preloaded the same column\\ndata as the primary system, becomes the primary system by replaying the last transaction\\nlogs, and then starts to accept queries.\\nNote the following for synchronous and asynchronous setups:\\nIn a synchronous state, no committed transaction is lost. The open transaction is restarted\\nand clients reconnect to SAP HANA for this. Synchronous setups are required for\\ndistances in the range 50-100 km.\\nIn case of an asynchronous setup, there is some loss. This depends on the time period\\nwhere the secondary site was not reachable or the line was too weak to cope with the data\\ntransfer quickly enough. These setups are used for longer distances, where the distance\\nbetween data centers is 100 km or more. However, they also occur if the impact of the\\nstandby process is not allowed to feedback into daily operation (change performance).\\nMinimal Setup for System Replication\\nThe minimal setup for system replication in one data center for fast takeovers is shown in the\\nfigure, Minimal Setup for System Replication.\\nUnit 3: SAP HANA Disaster Tolerance\\n© Copyright.

So only the net buffer size is transferred to the secondary site.\\nThe size of the filler entry is less than 4 KB. This is the maximum size reduction per sent log\\nbuffer. If the log buffers size is quite large, the compression ratio is quite limited.\\nLog buffer and page content compression can be activated by parameter settings.\\nLog buffers and data pages shipped to the secondary site can be compressed using a lossless\\ncompression algorithm (LZ4).

A takeover can only be performed as a whole system. A takeover on the level of\\na single tenant database is not possible.\\nIf a new tenant database is created in a configured SAP HANA system replication, it must\\nbe backed up to participate in the replication.\\nThereafter, the initial data shipping is started automatically for this tenant database. If a\\ntakeover is done while the initial data shipping is running and not finished, this new tenant\\ndatabase is not operational after takeover and must be recovered with backup and\\nrecovery.\\nIf an active tenant database is stopped in a running SAP HANA system replication, it is\\nstopped on the secondary site as well.\\nIf a takeover is done while tenant databases, which were part of the system replication, are\\nstopped, they are in the same state after takeover as they were on the primary site when\\nthey were stopped. The tenant databases must be started to complete the takeover.\\nIt is possible to copy or move tenant databases between SAP HANA systems using system\\nreplication technology.\\nHowever, you can only use this feature if system replication is not enabled for high\\navailability purposes on either the source or target system for the entire duration of the\\ncopy or move process.\\n© Copyright.

This is\\nthe starting point for a usual database restart, but many large data packages (main indexes)\\nare preloaded in-memory, as on the primary data center before takeover.

The takeover only requires a few\\nminutes and the committed transactions or data are not lost. You can then perform an\\nupgrade on the primary system, which is now in the role of secondary.\\nThe secondary system can be initially installed with the new software version, or upgraded to\\nthe new software version when replication is already configured. After you upgrade the\\nsecondary, you must replicate all data to the secondary system, which already has the new\\nsoftware version. When the secondary system is ACTIVE (all services have synced), you can\\nexecute a takeover on the secondary system. This step makes the secondary system\\nproductive with the new software version.\\nIn an Active/Active (read enabled) system replication setup, the version of the primary and\\nthe secondary systems must be identical. For the near zero downtime upgrade to work, the\\noperation mode on the secondary system is automatically set to logreplay . Like this, the\\ntwo systems can get back in sync before the takeover step. To reestablish the Active/Active\\n(read enabled) landscape at the end, the logreplay_readaccess  operation mode must be\\nexplicitly specified during the former registration of the primary system as a new secondary\\nsystem.\\n© Copyright.

This allows you to respond flexibly to changing resource requirements\\nand to manage your system landscape efficiently.\\nCopying and moving a tenant database are essentially the same processes. First, the tenant\\ndatabase is copied through the replication of all of its data to a newly created tenant database\\nin a target system. Once all data has been successfully transferred, the new tenant database\\nis started as a separate, independent database. If the aim is to move the tenant database to\\nthe new system, the original tenant database is deleted and the new tenant database takes\\nover.\\nFigure 107: Copying and Moving Tenant Databases\\nThe only difference between copying and moving a tenant database therefore, is what\\nhappens to the original tenant database after all data has been transferred to the new tenant\\ndatabase in the target system.\\n© Copyright.

You can simply copy the\\ntenant database as a template to other systems.\\nPrerequisites and Implementation Considerations\\nA new tenant database will be created in the target system. Therefore, the target tenant\\ndatabase must not already exist in the target system.\\nThe target system must have a software version equal to, or higher than the source\\nsystem.\\nDuring the copy and move process, data must be replicated using a secure (SSL/TLS)\\nnetwork connection by default.\\nIn a running system replication, it is possible to copy or move tenant databases into a\\nprimary system, or from a primary system into another target system that is different than\\nthe secondary system.\\nThere can be no changes to the topology of the original tenant database while the move or\\ncopy is in progress.\\nIf the source system is configured for host auto-failover, the copy or process fails in the\\nevent of failover to a standby host.\\nThe administrator has the system privilege DATABASE ADMIN.\\nTenant replication is configured.\\nA complete system backup for the source tenant database has been created.\\nUnit 4: SAP HANA Tenant Replication\\n© Copyright.
